## A: Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table,
write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, PL_PLAN_ID, START_DATE
FROM JOINED
ORDER BY CUSTOMER_ID, PL_PLAN_ID
```
Output: (limited to 10/2650 rows)
| customer_id | pl_plan_id | start_date |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1           | 0          | 2020-08-01 |
| 1           | 1          | 2020-08-08 |
| 2           | 0          | 2020-09-20 |
| 2           | 3          | 2020-09-27 |
| 3           | 0          | 2020-01-13 |
| 3           | 1          | 2020-01-20 |
| 4           | 0          | 2020-01-17 |
| 4           | 1          | 2020-01-24 |
| 4           | 4          | 2020-04-21 |
| 5           | 0          | 2020-08-03 |


We see that customers all start with plan 0(trial), after a week they switch to a permanent plan.

## B: Data Analysis 

Connect the data into a join for ease of access:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW JOINED AS
SELECT SUB.CUSTOMER_ID,
	SUB.PLAN_ID AS SUB_PLAN_ID,
	SUB.START_DATE,
	PL.PLAN_ID AS PL_PLAN_ID,
	PL.PLAN_NAME,
	PL.PRICE
FROM FF3.SUBSCRIPTIONS SUB
INNER JOIN FF3.PLANS PL ON SUB.PLAN_ID = PL.PLAN_ID;
```


**1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID)
FROM JOINED
```
Ouput:
| count |
|-------|
| 1000  |

  
***

**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value.**

````sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date), 'Month') AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS month_distribution
FROM joined
WHERE pl_plan_id = 0
GROUP BY month, DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date)
ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date)
````
Output:
|    month    | month_distribution |
|-------------|-------------------|
| January     | 88                |
| February    | 68                |
| March       | 94                |
| April       | 81                |
| May         | 88                |
| June        | 79                |

**3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name.**

where start_date >= '2021-01-01 00:00:00+08'
group by pl_plan_id
order by pl_plan_id
````
Output:
