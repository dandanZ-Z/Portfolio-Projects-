## A: Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table,
write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, PL_PLAN_ID, START_DATE
FROM JOINED
ORDER BY CUSTOMER_ID, PL_PLAN_ID
```
Output: (limited to 10/2650 rows)
| customer_id | pl_plan_id | start_date |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1           | 0          | 2020-08-01 |
| 1           | 1          | 2020-08-08 |
| 2           | 0          | 2020-09-20 |
| 2           | 3          | 2020-09-27 |
| 3           | 0          | 2020-01-13 |
| 3           | 1          | 2020-01-20 |
| 4           | 0          | 2020-01-17 |
| 4           | 1          | 2020-01-24 |
| 4           | 4          | 2020-04-21 |
| 5           | 0          | 2020-08-03 |


We see that customers all start with plan 0(trial), after a week they switch to a permanent plan.
