# Insights Gained

1. 55% of transactions are withdrawals with transfers at 22% and balance inquiries/deposits coming in at 11% each. 
   This means that the market Wisabi bank is serving mainly uses cash in its day to day life. 
   Some potential actions could include further optimizing ATMs for cash withdrawal, or inversely implementing cashless incentives to lessen the load on cash.

2. LAGOS has a higher Average Transaction amount but lower Average Duration per Transaction as compared to the state of KANO.
   This data point suggests KANO can further optimise their transaction processes, maybe even learning what LAGOS is doing well.
   It could also mean than KANO's ATMs require maintenance as their hardware is potentially on the slower side. 

3. KANO reaches its peak transaction count throughout the day the earliest and also drops-off quicker as compared to the other states.
   This could be related to the above insight where customers realise they take a longer time for transactions and so head to the ATM earlier in the day.

4. LAGOS has the highest average transaction count and also a much higher transaction count after office hours as compared to the other states.
   We can potentially infer than LAGOS is more cash dependent and/or is a generally busier city with longer working hours.

5. ATM utilisation rate in the Federal Capital Territory state is very low at 8.5% as compared to the rest at 12.9%. 
   This could mean that ATMs are generally not as accessible as transaction counts are relatively normal. 
   From this it could be said that most of the transactions are conducted online as opposed to ATMs.
   Some potential actions could be promotions to use ATMS more, or improve the online service to enhance customer experience.
